## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to...

1. The breakdown of student's personal demographics (first generation/immigrant, international, home state, legacy status), and the relationship it had with them getting accepted/rejected from Harvard

2. The impact of anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions on academic success

3. The association between women's pay and men's pay in the same sports, relative to viewership, sponsorship, advertisements, ticketing, and more.
